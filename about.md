# About Me #
Hello! My name is Timothy. I am a robotics engineer with degrees in aerospace engineering and robotics. I have worked on a variety of projects from embedded controls to neural networks, and hope to continue learning and growing! This website contains a portfolio of my work as I continue to explore new projects and catch up on old ones. Feel free to reach out with any comments or questions. Thanks!
